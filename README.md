# My Globo.com Static Page Project

Welcome to my Globo.com static recreation! As a web-dev project the ideia was to create a static webpage using HTML and CSS. This project was created based on a specific layout provided during my bootcamp course.

**Note**: This recreation isn't an exact replica of the current Globo.com site. Instead, it's designed to demonstrate the skills I've learned so far in my course, while adhering to a layout provided by my instructors.

## Tools Used

- HTML5: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- CSS3: For styling the webpage.
- Google Fonts: For importing the specific font required for the project (**Encode Sans**).

## Project Requirements

- [ ] Implemented the layout as per the design provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/TusiAOJUwrEsBph6gYhUNf/Projeto-Globo.com?mode=dev)
- [ ] Used the **Encode Sans** font on the page. Imported the font from Google Fonts:
    - Here's how I did it:
        1. Visited https://fonts.google.com/
        2. Searched for the **Encode Sans** font
        3. Selected all styles up to **Bold 700**
        4. Copied the HTML (the `link` tags) from the sidebar and pasted it within the `head` tag of my page
        5. Copied the `font-family` given in the sidebar and used it in the `body` style of my page
- [ ] Made all news items as links. Used a placeholder link (e.g., `https://globo.com`) for the time being.
- [ ] Used the `border-radius` property to create images with rounded corners

## Bonus Requirements
- [ ] The logo should change to the mobile logo
- [ ] The navigation menu should be below the logo
- [ ] News items should be stacked as shown in the [mobile layout](https://www.figma.com/file/NlzCsiMaDuGwvyRgaqrcFV/Projeto-Globo.com---B%C3%B4nus-Mobile?node-id=1%3A52&mode=dev)

I hope you find this project interesting! Feel free to explore and give feedback.
